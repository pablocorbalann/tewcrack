# This script is the main script for running the attack itself, without
# any kind of interface.
# This script can be run directly from the base directory if you do something
# like: bash run.sh "route to the attack", but it's not the best option, you should
# run the tewcrack.sh option, and it will check a lot of things that are needed to
# run this script, then you can select the second option and that's it!
# Good luck and use the script at your own risk!
# For more information check out: github.com/pablocorbalann/tewcrack.sh
echo "run"
